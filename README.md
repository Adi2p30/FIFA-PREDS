# FIFA-PREDS

Welcome to my project analyzing the performance of a team in the FIFA World Cup!
This project aims to provide insights into the performance of a specific team in the World Cup using data analysis. 
By examining factors such as team statistics, team strategy, we can gain a better understanding of the team's strengths and weaknesses and make predictions about their chances of winning in a match.
